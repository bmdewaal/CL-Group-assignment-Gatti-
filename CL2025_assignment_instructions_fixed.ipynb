To do so, use the words in the Dutch prevalence lexicon available in this OSF repository: https://osf.io/9zymw/. Essentially, you need to exclude any pseudoword that happens to be a word for which a prevalence estimate is available, whatever the prevalence is.\n",

You should follow the same pipeline as for the previous models, encoding both Dutch words from Speed and Brysbaert (2024) and the pseudowords from Gatti et al using the embedding of each string at layer 0, before positional information is factored in.

Only when you are positive it works, embed all strings."
