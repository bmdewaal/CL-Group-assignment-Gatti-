You should follow the same pipeline as for the previous models, encoding both Dutch words from Speed and Brysbaert (2024) and the pseudowords from Gatti et al using the embedding of each string at layer 0, before positional information is factored in. If a string consists of multiple tokens, average the embeddings of all tokens to produce the embedding of the whole string.
